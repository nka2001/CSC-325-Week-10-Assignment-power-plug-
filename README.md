# CSC-325-Week-10-Assignment-power-plug-
week 10 assignment, contains American to European adapter design pattern


Assignment Instructions: 

The objective of the Adapter Design Pattern is to create an intermediary abstraction that makes two incompatible interfaces work together. The adapter lets you create a middle-layer class between your code to legacy class, 3rd-party class, or any other class which you can’t change.

The problem with the Adapter Design Pattern is that the complexity of the code increases because you need to create & maintain new interfaces and classes. If possible, it’s often simpler just to change the target class so that it matches the rest of your code.

Problem 1:

The American power plug is incompatible with the European power sockets. Different countries sometimes have different electrical sockets. In order to make different electrical sockets work together with different plugs, the use of adapters is necessary.

 

Develop a Java application to simulate the use of the Adapter Design Pattern for the above problem.
